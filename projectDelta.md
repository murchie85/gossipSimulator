# Project Delta
  
This repo has two projects, a data dense terminal driven interface and a interactive accessible game version.  

The differences between Repositories so far are.  
   
- Game Functions, a number of pygame libs and designed functions are in game.

# ['movement'] in citizens_list  

This is an additional Key which has sub values relating to facing, direction etc. It is used in the game, but the MVP only requires a 1D movement axis as the focus there is not on visualising the distances.  
  

**game** has a `action` field for citizen to allow for throttling gossip actions.
