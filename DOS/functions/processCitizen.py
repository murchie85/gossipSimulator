# Program Name: Create_citizen
# Author: Adam McMurchie
# DOC: 23 April 2021
# Summary: This is a function called by main program to create citizens
# This function follows loosely SOLID principles, it creates a citizen only but uses libs to do things like name creation. 


Citizen Initialisation 

- `Id` = uniqueValue (use random name generator so can be in json and prevent duplicates)
- `status_points` = random(0,100)
- `create_gossip_probability` = random int 0-100
- `spread_gossip_probability` = random int 0-100
- `age` = 0
- `friends` = empty
- `subjective_rumour_tracker` empty / knownRumours
