# Gossip Simulator 

## Building Digital Fishwives 


![](https://cf.girlsaskguys.com/q3478164/primary-share.png?33)

In Yuval Harai's pivotal book [Sapiens](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/) the author explains how Story Telling and collective belief define the human race. In fact these uniquely human characteristics may have helped differentiate Sapiens from their historical competitors and allowed us to thrive into the technological society we have today. 

In this project I (Adam McMurchie) plan to build a series of bots which will simulate how a world will evolve overtime via a colection of rules which defines risks and rewards of rumour creation. These rules will be set at three tiers, environmental level, social level and household level. 

 Dumb rules based optimisers will play part of the relatively disengaged population who partake in occasional gossiping. 

 The Digital Fishwife: will be AI optimisers designed with two main optimisers in consideration:

 - Propagate Rumours
 - Gain Status by generating Rumors

 This may seem like the same thing, but one AI will be tasked with keeping
